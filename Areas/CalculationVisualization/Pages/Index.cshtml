<p><strong>Importance:</strong> ★★★★★</p>

<h2>What it includes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ability to calculate variations accurately and visualize resulting positions several moves ahead</li>
    <li>Evaluating outcomes (is a line better, equal, or worse?)</li>
    <li>Avoiding “hope chess” (relying on wishful outcomes)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>
    Even if you know what to look for positionally, you must calculate whether it works.
