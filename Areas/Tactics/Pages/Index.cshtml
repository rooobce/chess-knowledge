<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p><strong>Importance:</strong> ★★★★★ (Critical for all levels)</p>

<h2>What it includes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Recognizing common tactical motifs (pins, forks, skewers, discovered attacks, deflections, back-rank mates, etc.)</li>
    <li>Visualization and calculation of short forcing sequences</li>
    <li>Spotting threats and combinations quickly</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>
    Tactics decide most games at club level. Even grandmasters rely heavily on tactical accuracy to convert positional advantages.
    “Tactics flow from a superior position, but without tactics, even the best position collapses.”
</p>

<h2>Typical training focus</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Daily tactical puzzles (aim for quality over quantity)</li>
    <li>Use puzzle rush or motif-specific sets (e.g., Lichess, Chess.com, or books like Polgar’s 5334 Problems)</li>
    <li>Analyse your own games for missed tactics — both for and against</li>
    <li>Occasionally practice blindfold calculation to strengthen visualization during tactics</li>
</ul>
