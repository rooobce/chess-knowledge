<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p><strong>Importance:</strong> ★★★★☆ (essential for converting advantages and creating winning chances)</p>

<h2>What it includes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Recognizing when an attack is justified — understanding preconditions for attack:
        <ul>
            <li>Better development</li>
            <li>Open lines toward the enemy king</li>
            <li>Space advantage on the attacking flank</li>
            <li>Opponent’s weaknesses or lack of defenders</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Typical attacking patterns:
        <ul>
            <li>Greek gift sacrifice (Bxh7+)</li>
            <li>Opposite-side castling attacks</li>
            <li>Minority attack (queenside)</li>
            <li>Pawn storms and opening of lines</li>
            <li>Rook lifts, piece sacrifices for open files</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Coordination of forces: bringing all pieces into the attack efficiently</li>
    <li>Timing: knowing when to launch the attack versus when to keep improving your position</li>
    <li>Calculation & intuition blend: combining concrete tactics with intuitive sense of momentum</li>
    <li>Conversion: finishing the attack when the opponent is on the ropes (often requiring precision and cool nerves)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Many players lose winning positions because they either attack too early or too late.</li>
    <li>The ability to sense when “the attack is on” is a hallmark of strong players.</li>
    <li>It also teaches initiative — making threats that force your opponent to respond.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Typical training focus</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study attacking classics (Tal, Alekhine, Kasparov)</li>
    <li>Solve attacking puzzles</li>
    <li>Practice attacking in opposite-side castling positions</li>
    <li>Learn thematic sacrifices (on h7/h2, g5/g4, f7/f2, etc.)</li>
</ul>
