<p><strong>Importance:</strong> ★★★☆☆</p>

<h2>What it includes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Understanding mainline principles (development, centre control, king safety)</li>
    <li>Knowing typical plans and structures of your chosen openings</li>
    <li>Memorizing some key lines and move orders</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>
    Strong opening knowledge helps you reach middlegames you understand. However, pure memorization without understanding is fragile — knowing ideas is more valuable than memorizing 20 moves deep.
