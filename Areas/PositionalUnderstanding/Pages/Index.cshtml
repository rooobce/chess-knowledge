<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p><strong>Importance:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>

<h2>What it includes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Understanding pawn structures and their long-term implications</li>
    <li>Identifying weak squares, outposts, open files, and space advantages</li>
    <li>Manoeuvring pieces to optimal squares (piece activity)</li>
    <li>Evaluating static vs dynamic factors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>
    Positional understanding guides your strategic decisions when there’s no immediate tactic. It’s what lets you build advantages rather than hope for opponent mistakes.
</p>

<h2>Typical training focus</h2>
<ul>
    <li>“Guess the move” exercises with annotated master games</li>
    <li>Calculation drills (select a position and calculate for 5 minutes, then compare with engine or book)</li>
    <li>Visualization exercises (e.g., visualize a knight’s tour or replay short games blindfolded)</li>
    <li>Practice solving composed studies and calculation-intensive puzzles</li>
</ul>
