<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>
<p><strong>Importance:</strong> ★★★★★ (vital for survival at all levels; underrated but decisive at higher levels)</p>

<h2>What it includes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Accurate evaluation under pressure: realizing whether an attack is dangerous or just looks scary</li>
    <li>Calmness: maintaining objectivity when your king is under threat</li>
    <li>
        Defensive techniques:
        <ul>
            <li>Trading attacking pieces</li>
            <li>Returning material for simplification</li>
            <li>Creating counterplay elsewhere</li>
            <li>Blockading open lines</li>
            <li>Defending along the second/third rank</li>
            <li>King walks (often the most human, counterintuitive move)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Resourcefulness: finding practical ways to resist even in difficult positions</li>
    <li>Psychological defence: avoiding panic, managing time, and forcing your opponent to "prove it"</li>
    <li>Transitioning from defence to counterattack — knowing when the storm has passed and it is time to seize the initiative</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A good defender wins drawn positions and saves lost ones.</li>
    <li>Many attacking players collapse against calm, precise defenders (e.g., Karpov, Petrosian, or Ulf Andersson).</li>
    <li>Defence builds discipline, accuracy, and deeper understanding of chess truths.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Typical training focus</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study master games where one side successfully defended (e.g., Petrosian, Karpov, Kramnik)</li>
    <li>Set up defensive positions and practice holding them against an engine or partner</li>
    <li>Learn to exchange attackers and to simplify into holdable endgames</li>
    <li>Review your own losses — often they involve missed defensive resources</li>
</ul>
